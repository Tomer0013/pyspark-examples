# PySpark Examples
This repo contains a bunch of short PySpark examples to be used as reference.
All examples were originally developed in Scala and are taken from the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/. I converted all of the original Scala scripts to Python and PySpark for practice and future reference.

The data used is also from the course mentioned above, so I cannot include it in this repo. I kept only the dir structure for things to make sense.
